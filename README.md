## What is squaremap

squaremap (formerly known as Pl3xMap) is a minimalistic and lightweight live world map viewer for Minecraft servers.

squaremap hooks into your Minecraft server as a plugin or mod on a [supported platform](#supported-platforms), then generates and manages a live map of your server, viewable in any web browser.

## Features

* Ultra fast render times. Get your map rendered today, not next week.
* Simple vanilla-like top down 2D view, designed for navigation.
* Player markers showing yaw rotation, health, and armor.
* Easy to [setup](https://github.com/jpenilla/squaremap/wiki/Installation) and [configure](https://github.com/jpenilla/squaremap/wiki/Default-config.yml).
* Up to date Leaflet front-end.
* [Addons and integrations](https://github.com/jpenilla/squaremap/wiki/Addons) for many popular plugins.
